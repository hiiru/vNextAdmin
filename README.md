vNextAdmin
==========

vNext playground and PoC for a generic admin (code-defined)

This repository is used to learn about vNext.
In addition it's also an experiment to create a code-defined admin interface (using pre-defined elements), in theory it should be possible to map a Model to an Admin page without writing frontend code
